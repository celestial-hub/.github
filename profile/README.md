# Celestial Hub

The `Celestial` project is an intricate suite of tools designed for translating, executing, and interacting with MIPS assembly and three-address code. Inspired by the tools and themes of celestial navigation, each component plays a unique role in this ambitious journey.

## Components

### 1. MIPS Parser: `Astrolabe`

- **Reference:** An astrolabe is an ancient instrument used to observe the positions of stars. It's a complex tool used for navigation.
- **Correlation:** Like the parser, the astrolabe decodes information and makes it understandable, translating MIPS assembly language into a structure your programs can navigate.

### 2. MIPS Virtual Machine: `Sextant`

- **Reference:** A sextant is an instrument that measures angles between celestial objects. It's crucial for pinpointing locations at sea.
- **Correlation:** The VM plays a similar role in pinpointing the precise state of the program, executing instructions just like a sextant helps navigate the vast sea.

### 3. Three-Address Code to MIPS Converter: `Compass`

- **Reference:** A compass is used to find direction and guide one's path.
- **Correlation:** The converter guides the translation from a higher-level representation (three-address code) to a specific target (MIPS), just like a compass guides you to your destination.

### 4. Front-End Application: `Horizon`

- **Reference:** The horizon is the line where the earth meets the sky, the ultimate visual goal for navigators.
- **Correlation:** The front-end application is the point where users meet and interact with the underlying machinery of the entire system, much like the horizon connects the earth and sky.

### 5. Whole Project: `Celestial`

- **Reference:** Celestial navigation is a practice of using the positions of celestial bodies to navigate, which ties together the themes of the individual components.
- **Correlation:** Your entire project is a suite of tools working together to translate, execute, and interact with MIPS assembly and three-address code, much like the celestial tools guiding a journey.
